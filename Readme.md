This project was submitted for my Modelling, Simulation and Optimization continuous assessment. It involves simulating the merge of a three-lane traffic highway into a two-lane traffic highway. The project is inspired by the 'Self organizing motorway" research carried out by Trinity College Dublin. 

For the simulation in this paper, we aim to answer questions like

1. What is the number of vehicles per kilometer available on all lanes, k, and the mean speed of the vehicles, u?
2. What is the volume of vehicles passing all the lanes per hour and the average total travelling time?
3. What is the highest traffic volume the motorway can accommodate and give recommendations on speed limits for the motorway segment?

A csv of results is attached in this repository to show our simulation given varying parameters like number of vehicles on the road, their inter arrival time, the speed limit of the highway, the average speed of the vehicles. the total flow of vehicles in an hour, average traveling time, number of emergency braking and number of crashes. 

A report on this project is attached and the results of the simulation explained therein.
